## ADR-001 — Agent Cannot Call Broker Directly

**Status:** Accepted

### Context

LLM and ML components are probabilistic and may produce invalid or unsafe actions.

### Decision

All trading actions must follow:

```text
Agent -> TradeProposal -> RiskEngine -> Portfolio Manager -> Order Manager -> Broker
```

No agent component receives broker credentials or a direct execution tool.

### Consequences

- safer system boundaries,
- easier auditing,
- easier simulation,
- risk rules remain enforceable,
- slightly more implementation complexity.

## ADR-002 — Start With Offline Micro Gold Research

**Status:** Accepted

### Context

The first instrument is Micro Gold futures (MGC). The initial work must not place
trades or consume Databento credits.

### Decision

Build and test the data validation, baseline strategy, deterministic risk checks,
and futures simulation with local synthetic data. Do not connect to Databento or a
broker during this phase. A later integration requires an explicit decision about
data use and a broker-specific paper trading gate before any live trading.

### Consequences

- The research loop can be developed and tested with zero external account activity.
- Historical performance and broker behavior remain unverified until real data and
  paper integration are deliberately introduced.
